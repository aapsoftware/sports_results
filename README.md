# Task statement
Use the following API to retrieve sports results and sort into a table of results that are displayed in the CLI. Each sport result contains several data and always includes the publication time. 
    Method: POST
    Content-Type: application/json
    Url: https://restest.free.beeceptor.com/results 
Tasks:
-	Create python script that displays the sports results in reverse chronological order in the CLI.
-	Add an argument to the script to display only certain types or events (e.g. f1Results)
-	Add an argument to set the locale (e.g. en)
-	How can you confirm the code works?
-	Bonus: Implement the rest call asynchronously
